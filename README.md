# Key-Bored
Find your optimal keyboard!!!

# Pure Python, From Scratch!!!
This program is written entirly from scratch with basic python code.

There are no external libraries except for: `os`, `random`, and `math`.

# How does it work?
This program uses a basic genetic algorithm, where the best performing keyboard is picked from the population throughout the generations, and with each new generation, a mutated version of that keyboard is created, and the cycle repeats!
